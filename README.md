# CP/Mega88 for Raspberry Pi Pico

A porting toyoshima-san's cp-mega88 to Raspberry Pi Pico.

The original cp-mega88 locates https://github.com/toyoshim/cp-mega88.  It is an i8080 emulator running on ATmega88, and on which CP/M can run.  I would like to have a CP/M machine on my 'z80_pico' project(https://github.com/tendai22/z80_pico), in which an actual Z80 CPU runs with a modern Raspberry Pi Pico.  I choose cp-mega88 as a base implementation of CP/M.  This project is for porting cp-mega88 on Raspberry Pi Pico, and on z80_pico.
